= Farewell to Google Code

Time goes on and things have changed. Well, seems like I can't host my scripts on Google Code anymore because Google has announced to close Google Code project.

This is what has been stated on their site :


- March 12, 2015 - New project creation disabled.
- August 24, 2015 - The site goes read-only. You can still checkout/view project source, issues, and wikis.
- January 25, 2016 - The project hosting service is closed. You will be able to download a tarball of project source, issues, and wikis. These tarballs will be available throughout the rest of 2016.

You still have projects hosted there? Hurry up export them to Github. It's easy, just go to your project page and click *Export to Github*. Then Follow the instructions. _Done!_

Lastly, sayonara Google Code! Thank you for providing this great service for the open source community over the years.
